# Jupiter
Jupiter is a micro framework library that simplifies development of UWP apps. It is partly based on [Template10](https://github.com/Windows-XAML/Template10). Most of my personal Windows 10 apps (like [Meridian](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrdmsq3), [Colibri](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrdmspr), [Fit Diary](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh0cfsh), [Moodflow](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrdmspm)) were built with this library.
