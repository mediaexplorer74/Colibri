# Colibri v3.0.1 - master branch

![](/Images/logo.png)

My fork of Artem Shuba's Colibri UWP App.

So, this is the UWP version for Windows 10/Mobile (min. os. build: 10240).

## About
My "Project Calibri" is synthez of 2 Artem Shuba's projects: Colibri & Meridian. 
So, it planned as messenger + music player which allows you to listen to music from popular Russian social network [vk.com](https://vk.com).

## My 2 cents
- VK Api version increased, VK login is ok at now
- Initial state of Messenger+Music Player conjunction  
- Astoria 10240 - successfully compiled but app don t want to start :(

## Big problem
- New Auth/Login "mechanics" (Android masking) damaged notifications :(

## TODO / The fields to improve 
- All code exploring/refactoring (UI, controls, localization...)
- Additional tests 
- Try to migrate from vk.com to vk.ru
