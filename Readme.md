## My 2 cents

- Exception "8:Invalid request: versions below 5.81 are deprecated" fixed (I set vk version to 5.82).
- Min. os. win build downdraded to 10240 for better Astoria compatibility :)
- Tested (a little) at my Lumias (950, 640 DS and 640 with Astoria). All seems to be ok, over 7 (!) years. Artem is genious :)
